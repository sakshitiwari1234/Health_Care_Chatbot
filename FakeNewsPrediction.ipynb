[Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed \\u201cno debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be\\u201d (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). \\u201cI am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us \\u2014  the 400 of us,\\u201d Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom \\u2014  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for \\u201cempathy\\u201d for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented \\u201cBlack Power demagogues\\u201d and \\u201celitist arrogance and repressive intolerance\\u201d within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. \\u201cTrust,\\u201d Rodham ironically observed in 1969, \\u201cthis is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said \\u2018Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust.\\u2019 What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted?\\u201d The \\u201ctrust bust\\u201d certainly busted Clinton\\u2019s 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people \\u2014  Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to November\\u2019s election \\u2014  stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a \\u201clie,\\u201d a \\u201ccon,\\u201d \\u201calternative facts,\\u201d and \\u201ca   assault on truth and reason. \\u201d She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. \\u201cAs the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,\\u201d she offered. \\u201cThat is not hyperbole. \\u201d Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that \\u201cfor too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. \\u201d Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. \\u201cWhy aren\\u2019t I 50 points ahead?\\u201d she asked in September. In May she asks why she isn\\u2019t president. The woman famously dubbed a \\u201ccongenital liar\\u201d by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in \\u2014  theirs, mind you, not hers. Getting stood up on Election Day, like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day, inspires dangerous delusions.\",\n          \"Print \\nAn Iranian woman has been sentenced to six years in prison after Iran\\u2019s Revolutionary Guard searched her home and found a notebook that contained a fictional story she\\u2019d written about a woman who was stoned to death, according to the Eurasia Review . \\nGolrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, 35, is the wife of political prisoner Arash Sadeghi, 36, who is serving a 19-year prison sentence for being a human rights activist, the publication reported. \\n\\u201cWhen the intelligence unit of the Revolutionary Guards came to arrest her husband, they raided their apartment \\u2013 without a warrant \\u2013 and found drafts of stories that Ebrahimi Iraee had written,\\u201d the article stated. \\n\\u201cOne of the confiscated drafts was a story about stoning women to death for adultery \\u2013 never published, never presented to anyone,\\u201d the article stated. \\u201cThe narrative followed the story of a protagonist that watched a movie about stoning of women under Islamic law for adultery.\",\n          \"Why the Truth Might Get You Fired October 29, 2016 \\nThe tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results, with the latter often overwhelming the former, as in the Iraq War, writes Lawrence Davidson. \\nBy Lawrence Davidson \\nFor those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis. The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. \\nBack in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country\\u2019s dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for \\u201cregime change\\u201d in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) \\nFor our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? \\nThe short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. \\nBut the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. government\\u2019s payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. \\nWhat we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. \\nSo the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. \\nOn March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. \\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? \\nThe various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out \\u2013 specifically, how to tell when they are getting \\u201ctrue\\u201d intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need \\u201c help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. \\u201d To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. \\nA \\u201cpartnership\\u201d is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a \\u201c permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board\\u201d to coordinate programs in \\u201csocial and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .\\u201d \\nDespite this effort, it is almost certain that the \\u201csocial and behavioral sciences\\u201d cannot give the spy agencies what they want \\u2013 a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. \\nThe Believers \\nIt is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth \\u2013 that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (right) talks with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, with John Brennan and other national security aides present.

However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors \\u2013 those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview \\u2013 have different criterion for what is \\u201ctrue\\u201d than do the analysts. \\nListen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council \\u2013 yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared, \\u201c We\\u2019re looking for truth. But we\\u2019re particularly looking for truth that works. \\u201d Now what might that mean? \\nI can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, \\u201ctruth\\u201d must match up, fit with, their worldview \\u2013 their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not \\u201cwork.\\u201d So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by \\u201cgroup think,\\u201d ideological blinkers, and a \\u201cwe know better\\u201d attitude. \\nOn the other hand, as long as what you\\u2019re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory \\u2013 the list is almost endless. \\nWhat does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers \\u2013 the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class \\u2013 presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. \\nIt has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of Shakespeare\\u2019s determination that \\u201cwhat is past, is prelude.\\u201d Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will \\u2013 no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. Yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power.
